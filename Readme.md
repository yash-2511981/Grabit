## üìê Architectural Strategy: Multi-Client, Monolith API

The platform uses a **Multi-Client Frontend** served by a **Single Monolithic Express API**. This choice was a deliberate, UX-driven engineering decision designed to optimize for diverse user needs and future scalability.

### 1. UX-Driven Frontend Segregation

We built four distinct frontends to provide an ideal experience for each user role:

| Module Set                  | Design Rationale                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User & Delivery Partner** | **Mobile-First Priority:** UIs are optimized for small screens to cater to on-the-go usage. This design choice simplifies the eventual transition to native mobile applications (Android/iOS). |
| **Vendor & Admin**          | **Desktop-Optimized:** UIs prioritize large-screen productivity, complex data reporting, and complex form interactions (e.g., subscription and product management).                            |

### 2. Backend Segregation & Security

A single Monolithic Express.js API handles all business logic, ensuring a consistent data model.

- **Custom Middleware:** All routes are protected by robust **JWT Validation** and **Custom Middleware** that checks the user's role/scope.
- **API Security:** This ensures complete API segregation, preventing any client (e.g., a User) from accessing unauthorized endpoints (e.g., `/api/vendor/orders`).
